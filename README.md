This directory contains all the code utilizes to generate the experimental results on the paper titled "FDR-SVM: A Federated Distributionally Robust Support Vector Machine via a Mixture of Wasserstein Balls Ambiguity Set". Each directory corresponds to an experiment in the paper, and contains an additional "readme.txt" file specific to running the code of that experiment.

If you have any questions or encounter any bugs in the code, please contact the corresponding author:
